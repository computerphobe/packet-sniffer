# üêç Enhanced Python Packet Sniffer

![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.7+-blue.svg)

A powerful, command-line packet sniffer built with Python and Scapy. This tool allows you to capture and inspect network traffic in real-time, log data, and perform basic threat detection.

---

## ## Features

* **Live Packet Capture:** Sniff network packets on any specified network interface.
* **Protocol Dissection:** Analyzes and displays data from `IPv4`, `IPv6`, `TCP`, `UDP`, and `ARP` layers.
* **PCAP Logging:** Save captured traffic directly to a `.pcap` file for later analysis in tools like Wireshark.
* **üõ°Ô∏è ARP Spoofing Detection:** Monitors ARP replies and alerts you if an IP address suddenly claims a new MAC address.
* **üëÅÔ∏è Port Scan Detection:** Detects and flags rapid `TCP SYN` requests from a single source to a single destination.
* **Powerful Filtering:** Uses BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) syntax to capture only the traffic you care about.
* **Command-Line Interface:** Easy-to-use flags for specifying interfaces, filters, and output files.

## ## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

1.  **Python 3.7+**
2.  **Scapy:** The core packet manipulation library.
    ```bash
    pip install scapy
    ```
3.  **Packet Capture Driver:** Scapy needs a low-level driver to interact with the network interface.
    * **Windows:** You must install **Npcap**.
        * Download from the [Npcap website](https://npcap.com/#download).
        * **Important:** During installation, select the option **"Install Npcap in WinPcap API-compatible Mode"**.
    * **Linux / macOS:** You'll need `libpcap`. It is typically pre-installed on most modern systems.

## ## üöÄ Usage

This script must be run with **root or administrator privileges** to allow for raw socket access.

### ### Command-Line Options

| Flag | Argument | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `-i`, `--interface` | `eth0` | Network interface to sniff on. |
| `-f`, `--filter` | `"tcp port 80"` | BPF filter to apply to the capture. |
| `-o`, `--output` | `capture.pcap` | Output file to save captured packets. |
| `-h`, `--help` | | Show the help message. |

### ### Examples

* **Sniff all traffic and print to console:**
    ```bash
    # On Linux/macOS
    sudo python3 sniffer.py

    # On Windows (in an Administrator PowerShell/CMD)
    python sniffer.py
    ```

* **Sniff on a specific interface and save to a file:**
    ```bash
    sudo python3 sniffer.py -i eth0 -o traffic_log.pcap
    ```

* **Capture only DNS traffic and save it:**
    ```bash
    sudo python3 sniffer.py -f "udp port 53" -o dns_queries.pcap
    ```
